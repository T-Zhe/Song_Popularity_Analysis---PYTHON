# Song_Popularity_Analysis

Only 0.4% of musicians can make a living wage from streaming revenue. 

This objective is to help the overwhelming majority of musicians to achieve profitability by producing potentially popular songs, according to data.

Dataset used: song popularity from Spotify with music tagging factors, including track artist, playlist genre and subgenre, Danceability, Energy, Key, Loudness, Mode, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, and Tempo. These attributes can help us label songs and probe the sharing characteristics of popular songs.

I began with Data Exploration to understand factors attributing song popularity and identify key trends in song popularity. 
I then build a Predictive Model on non-popular musicians to determine the factors resulting in high popularity, which the artists can use to obtain the song's attribute index and predict its popularity potential. 

I used Decision Tree and Random Forest, then KNeighborsClassifier function in sklearn for Machine Learning and modeling.
